Being born in the late 70's gave me an extraordinary opportunity. While growing up, I was able to see computers evolve and become the amazing electronic devices they are today. Technology has developed exponentially in the past 40 years and will continue to do so. Seeing this rapid development has fascinated me and fueled my passion for computers. The advancements in technology consistently amaze me. How does a computer that once took up an entire room now fit in your pocket?? What about the computer on my wrist?? It is a thousand times more powerful than a computer I used in middle school. How will science advance in another 25 years? This is what gave me passion for computer science. I look forward to being  part of the change and mold it into what it is going to be tomorrow.
